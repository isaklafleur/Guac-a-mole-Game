  Guac-a-mole Game</h1>

<p align=center>A silly whack-a-mole Game... :-)</p>

## Demo & Usage

You can play the game here (works both on mobile and desktop) [Gua-ca-mole](http://online08.com/guacamole)

Need to hit the guacamole icon before times runs out. You have 5 lives to start with. For each 10 points score increase you bump up one level and speed increase.
